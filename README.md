# pandas-challenge

Overview:
This analysis includes various metrics such as average math and reading scores, passing rates, and performance based on school size and type.

Utilized Python and Pandas library for data analysis. 

Data sets used for this project:
schools_data.csv: Contains information about schools in the district including school name, type, size, and budget.
students_data.csv: Contains information about students including their names, grades, scores, and the school they attend.

Analysis: 

First step: Data cleaning and preperation

Second step: Calculate district and school summaries

Third step: Identify the top and bottom performing schools based on overall passing rates. 

Forth step: Analyze average math and reading scores for each grade level.

Fifth step: Analyze scores by spending, per-student budget range.

Sixth step: Analyze performance based on school size (small, medium, large) and analyze performance based on school type (distric or charter).
